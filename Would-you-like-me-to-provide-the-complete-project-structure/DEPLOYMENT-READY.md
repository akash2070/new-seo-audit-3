# Deployment Status: READY ✅

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Railway Configuration ✅
- Fixed `railway.json`: Changed from `npm run dev` to `npm start`
- Fixed `Procfile`: Updated to use proper production command
- Added `nixpacks.toml` for optimized build process

### 2. Port Configuration ✅
- Updated server to use `process.env.PORT` for Railway's dynamic port assignment
- Maintains fallback to port 5000 for local development

### 3. Environment Variables ✅
- Removed `.env` file from repository (security best practice)
- Updated `.env.example` with production template
- Railway will use dashboard environment variables

### 4. Build Optimization ✅
- Created optimized Vite configuration for production
- Added proper chunk splitting to reduce build time
- Excluded problematic icon processing from optimization

### 5. Production Dependencies ✅
- Build process now uses `npm ci` for faster, reliable installs
- Proper production environment configuration
